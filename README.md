#Matrix

###Matrix is a command line application which is used for solving simple linear algebra problems.<br>
###This repository is synchronized with XCode, but the file in "Matrix" folder is still compatible with Windows IDE (Such as Visual Studio)<br>
There are some MODEs that you can choose to solve different kinds of problems.<br>
Some MODE will ask you to input the value of 'm' or â€˜n', which represents row and column number of a matrix.<br><br>
According to mathematics principles, Inverse Matrix, Adjoint Matrix and Determinant are only available for Square Matrix.<br><br>
