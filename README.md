# Matrix

### Description
Matrix is a command line application which is used for solving simple linear algebra problems.

This program works well on UNIX/Linux plaforms, but files in "Matrix" folder is still compatible with Windows (With some functions disabled)

All source code file except "cJSON.c" and "cJSON.h" are written by Yanzhe Lee.

### Story of this project

This is the first programming project of me when I started first year CS courses at HIT.

So the implementations of matrix operations are very naive without any optimization.

I just use this project for learning C language as well as Linear Algebra.

### Features

There are some MODEs that you can choose to solve different kinds of problems.

Some MODE will ask you to input the value of 'm' or â€˜n', which represents row and column number of a matrix.

According to mathematics principles, Inverse Matrix, Adjoint Matrix and Determinant are only available for Square Matrix.

	 ]
}
